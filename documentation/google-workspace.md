## Google Workspace

Because Scouting Lommel is a non-profit youth organisation, we are eligable for a [Google Workspace for Non-profits](https://www.google.com/nonprofits/offerings/workspace/). This gives us access to a suite of free tools, such as:

- A **Gmail** account for every user, with a custom domain name
- A **Google Drive** with shared drives
- A **Google Meet** for business subscription
- Countless other tools

## Email setup

The email setup consists of different types of e-mail addresses.

### Personal

Every user has their own personal email adress that follows the `firstname.lastname@scoutinglommel.be` structure. A user can access their e-mail in their online mailbox ([mail.google.com](https://mail.google.com)) or by adding their `@scoutinglommel.be` e-mail to their existing mailing client.

### Groups

Users can be assigned to one or more groups. A group functions as a mailing list. The group's e-mail address follows the `groupname@scoutinglommel.be` structure. When an e-mail is sent to a group's e-mail address, the e-mail gets forwarded to the users assigned to that group. Existing groups include, but may not be limited to:

- `leiding@scoutinglommel.be`
- `groepsleiding@scoutinglommel.be`
- `vzw@scoutinglommel.be`
- `verhuur@scoutinglommel.be`
- `kapoenenleiding@scoutinglommel.be`
- `welpenleiding@scoutinglommel.be`
- `akabeleiding@scoutinglommel.be`
- `jonggiverleiding@scoutinglommel.be`
- `giverleiding@scoutinglommel.be`
- `jinleiding@scoutinglommel.be`
- `webmaster@scoutinglommel.be`
- `bbbbb@scoutinglommel.be`

## Google Drive

In Google Workspace, you can set up shared drives. To manage access to these drives, we utilize the group-based access control method. When a group was given access to a shared drive, the users asigned to that group will automatically be able to access that drive as well. Some examples of shared drives:

- A drive for every 'tak'
- A drive for the 'groupsleiding'
- A drive for the webmasters
- A drive for photos
- Etc...
