# AuthButton Component

A dynamic authentication button component that changes its appearance and functionality based on the user's authentication state.
It integrates with NextAuth for authentication and provides different navigation options for authenticated users.

## Overview

The AuthButton component serves two main purposes:

1. For **unauthenticated users**: displays a login button
2. For **authenticated users**: Shows a dropdown menu with dashboard access and user information

## Features

- Integrates with NextAuth for authentication state management
- Conditional rendering based on authentication state
- Role-based access control for organization groups
- Customizable dropdown menu for authenticated users

## Technical Considerations

1. Marked as a client component with `'use client'`
2. Uses NextAuth session management
3. Integrates with organization permission system
4. Dynamic dropdown menu based on user permissions
5. Consistent navigation item styling through `<NavItem />` component

## Accessibility

- Uses semantic navigation elements
- Maintains consistent keyboard navigation
- Provides clear visual feedback for interactive elements
- Supports screen readers through appropriate ARIA labels (inherited from `<NavItem />`)

## Notes

- The component uses a fixed `itemKey` of `99` for navigation ordering
- All hardcoded text is internationalized for multi-language support
- The dropdown menu is only rendered for authenticated users
- Permission checks affect the available dropdown options
